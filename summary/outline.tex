This dissertation is organized as follows.
Chapter~\ref{sec:va} introduces our scoring system for combining verification tools and describes how the \VAssist works.
The \AutoProof tool we have developed and integrated in the \VAssist is described in detail in Chapter~\ref{sec:ap}.
In Chapter~\ref{sec:eval} we show an evaluation of the \AutoProof tool on challenge problems and its usage in the classroom.
Chapter~\ref{sec:method} describes new verification methodologies we have developed and implemented in \AutoProof.
In Chapter~\ref{sec:concl_fut} we conclude and discuss future work.

The appendix consists of additional resources on \AutoProof: 
Appendix~\ref{sec:ap-tutorial} has a tutorial on \AutoProof, covering different aspects of verification with \AutoProof. The \AutoProof user manual in Appendix~\ref{sec:ap-manual} describes in a more systematic way the usage, options, capabilities, and limitations of \AutoProof.
